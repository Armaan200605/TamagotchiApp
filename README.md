Creating a Tamagotchi app:
 What is Tamagotchi? 
A Tamagotchi is a digital pet that anyone can look after and do activities such as playing, feeding and cleaning the pet on their smartphones or other devices. It is made for entertainment purposes.

Objective:
The objective is to create a Tamagotchi app for android devices that features a welcome page that guides users into the game where they can then feed, play and clean their virtual pet. The user will be able to see when it is necessary to feed, play and clean their virtual pet via the appropriate progress bar statuses.

How will the app work?

The user will be presented with a login page that welcomes and introduces the user to their Tamagotchi pet and guides them to the main page.

The user will be allowed to feed, play, and clean the pet depending on the pet’s hunger, health, and cleanliness status. 

The user will press the feed button to feed the pet, the user will press the play button to play with the pet and the clean button to clean the pet.






Purpose:
With its straightforward and easy-to-use interface, the Tamagotchi app's user-friendly design makes it simple and quick for users to take care of their pet. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing and captivating, the app's color scheme and images have been deliberately selected to have a relaxing and calming impact that can aid in lowering tension and anxiety. 
The three main parameters that drive the app's operation are hunger, cleanliness, and health. The measurements are shown as decreasing progress bars that show the current state of the pet. To make these progress bars larger and maintain the wellbeing and happiness of their pet, users can carry out particular behaviors.

Design considerations:

 
Users with disabilities can now access the Tamagotchi app thanks to its design. For users with visual impairments, the app features clear, high-contrast images and large, easy-to-read text. Large touch targets and obvious feedback when a button is pressed make the app's buttons and controls easy to use even for people with motor impairments. 

 
The app also has a notification system that lets users know when their pet isn't eating, isn't clean, or isn't feeling well. This makes it simple and quick for users to take the necessary care of their pet. With settings for notification frequency and type, this system can be tailored to the user's preferences. 
The Tamagotchi app features an intuitive UI, eye-catching images, and three primary metrics: hunger, cleanliness, and health. Ultimately, the app's design and operation are centered on simplicity, ease of use, and accessibility. For users of all ages and skill levels, the app's mini-games and notification system provide depth and interest, making it an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. 

GitHub and GitHub actions:
GitHub is a well-known site for version control and collaboration that hosts the source code of the application. App deployment, testing, and build are all automated with GitHub Actions, a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution. 
The following steps are part of the app's GitHub Actions workflow: 
⦁ Visit the GitHub repository to view the source code for the app. 
⦁ Create the application with Gradle, an Android build automation tool. 
To make that the app's functionality is operating as intended, run unit tests. 
Create a release artefact that contains the APK file for the application together with any additional files required for its deployment. 
⦁ Post the release artefact to the Releases page of the GitHub repository. 
The development team of the app can lower the likelihood of mistakes and problems in the finished product by utilising GitHub Actions to guarantee that the app is produced and tested regularly. In addition, the team may concentrate on other facets of app development because the automated deployment process saves time and effort. The Tamagotchi app offers players a distinctive and fulfilling experience as a fun and captivating digital pet simulation game. The primary criteria of hunger, cleanliness, and health are highlighted in the app's design and functionality, which is centered around simplicity and ease of use. A consistent and dependable development process is ensured by using GitHub and GitHub Actions for version control and automation, which lowers the possibility of mistakes and problems in the finished output.
